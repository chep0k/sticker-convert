## 4 Running the script
Change directory into `sticker_convert` directory and run `python ./main.py`

# Compiling
This repository uses `pyinstaller` for compiling. Install with `pip3 install pyinstaller`

## Compiling on windows
1. Refer to the instructions in running python script directly for installing python modules and executables
2. Run `pyinstaller sticker_convert.spec`
3. Compilation result in `dist` directory

##  Compiling on MacOS
1. Refer to the instructions in running python script directly for installing python modules and binaries (Except imagemagick, ffmpeg and ffprobe)
2. `ImageMagick` precompiled portable version is broken in newer releases of MacOS. You need to compile ImageMagick. Run `magick-compile-macos.sh` first

    - Ref2: https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/3129
3. Get static build of `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` from: https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/ (If down, then go to https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). 
4. Place `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe` and `apngdis` inside `sticker_convert/bin`
5. Run `pyinstaller sticker_convert.spec`
6. Compilation result in `dist` directory
